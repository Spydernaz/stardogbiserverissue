Netflix is eyeing the Watergate scandal as the subject of its next high-profile miniseries.
A drama titled Watergate is being developed by George Clooney and Bridge of Spies writer Matt Charman. Clooneyâ€™s Smokehouse Pictures will produce the eight-episode limited series, with the film star and his partner Grant Heslov serving as executive producers. Charman is writing the script for the project, which also hails from Sonar Entertainment (which signed a first-look deal with Smokehouse last year). Netflix declined to comment.
